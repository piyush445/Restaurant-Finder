# Restaurant-Finder
This is an assignment app built using flutter framework.
This app lists all the restuarants fetched using mocky api along with search functionality which on tap further shows further details of a restaurant.
This app is built as per the guidelines of the assignment.
To install flutter here- https://flutter.dev/
You can build for android in android studio or VS code and for ios you need mac and Xcode.
I have also included the build apk under Universal Apk folder.
